Rigging and animation tools for Maya

Tested in Maya 2016 and 2017

## Requirements

Get Qt.py from here https://github.com/mottosso/Qt.py/blob/master/Qt.py
Place it in a scripts folder (adjacent to the motiga folder is fine).
This beautiful file makes supporting Maya's change to PySide2 in 2017 painless.

## Installation
Download, unzip and put the "motiga" folder in one of your Maya script folders.

## Usage
In the script editor, in a Python tab, run:

```python
import motiga.tool.fossil.main
motiga.tool.fossil.main.RigTool()
```

More instructions pending.
